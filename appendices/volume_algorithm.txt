== TransferFunction1D Example Algorithm

The following is a possible ray-marching implementation of the
`transferFunction1D` volume. Implementations are not required to implement this
but are encouraged to use it as a reference when adapting other algorithms to
produce visually similar results.

....
ColorAccumulator = 0
Transmittance = 1

while x in volume
   StepColor = color(value(x)).rgb
   StepOpacity = color(value(x)).a * opacity(value(x))

   StepTransmittance = pow(1 - StepOpacity, step / unitDistance)

   ColorAccumulator += Transmittance * (1 - StepTransmittance) * StepColor

   Transmittance *= StepTransmittance

   x += direction * step
....

Any transformations the volume is subject to are assumed to be taken into
account during sampling of `value(x)`.

The current sample location `x` is in world space. The `direction` vector is the
view/ray direction and is assumed to be normalized. The variables `value`,
`opacity`, `color` and `unitDistance` are parameters of the `transferFunction1D`
volume object.
