=== Spatial Field

[[anariNewSpatialField]]
ANARI spatial field objects define collections of data values spread throughout
a local coordinate system in order to be sampled in space. Spatial fields are
created with

[source,cpp]

[[object_types_spatial_field_structured_regular]]
==== Structured Regular

Extension `KHR_SPATIAL_FIELD_STRUCTURED_REGULAR`

Structured regular spatial fields are created by passing the subtype string
`structuredRegular` to <<object_types_spatial_field, `anariNewSpatialField`>>. The parameters
understood by structured regular spatial fields are summarized in the table below.

.Configuration parameters for structured regular spatial fields.

|===================================================================================================
| Name    | Type           |    Default | Description
| data    |`ARRAY3D` of `UFIXED8` / `FIXED16` / `UFIXED16` / `FLOAT32` / `FLOAT64` | | the actual field
                                          values for the 3D grid, i.e., the scalars are
                                          vertex-centered; the size and value type of the spatial field
                                          is inferred from `data`
| origin  |`FLOAT32_VEC3`  |  (0, 0, 0) | origin of the grid in object-space
| spacing |`FLOAT32_VEC3`  |  (1, 1, 1) | size of the grid cells in object-space
| filter  |`STRING`        |    `linear`| filter used for reconstructing the field,
                                          possible values: `nearest`, `linear`
|===================================================================================================

The spatial field grid can be moved with `origin` and scaled with `spacing`, in
local object coordinates. The spatial field data is interpreted to be
vertex-centered, which means at least two data values need to be
specified in each dimension to avoid a degenerated spatial field. Its local
bounds are [`origin`, `origin` + (`data`.size - 1) {times} `spacing`].

Applications which set unknown values for `filter` will result in the default
being used.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Structured regular fields only need to store the values of the samples, because
their addresses in memory can be easily computed from a 3D position. A
common type of structured spatial fields are regular grids.

[[object_types_spatial_field_amr]]
==== Adaptive Mesh Refinement 

Extension `KHR_SPATIAL_FIELD_AMR`

Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) spatial fields are created by passing the subtype string
`amr` to <<object_types_spatial_field, `anariNewSpatialField`>>. The parameters
understood by AMR spatial fields are summarized in the table below.

.Configuration parameters for AMR spatial fields.
[cols="<,<2,>,<5",options="header,unbreakable"]
|===================================================================================================
| Name         | Type                     | Default   | Description
| block.data   |`ARRAY1D` of `ARRAY3D` of `FLOAT32` | | array of 3D arrays containing the scalar voxel data 
| gridOrigin   |`FLOAT32_VEC3`            | (0, 0, 0) | origin of the grid in object-space
| gridSpacing  |`FLOAT32_VEC3`            | (1, 1, 1) | size of the grid cells in object-space
| method       |`STRING`                  | `current` | sampling method, possible values are: `current`, `finest`, `octant` 
| cellWidth    |`ARRAY1D` of `FLOAT32`    | | array of each level's cell width 
| block.bounds |`ARRAY1D` of `INT32_BOX3` | | array of grid sizes, in voxels, for each AMR block 
| block.level  |`ARRAY1D` of `INT32`      | | array of each block's refinement level 
|===================================================================================================

AMR blocks are defined by three parameters: their bounds, the refinement level in which they reside, and
the scalar data contained within each block. The coarsest refinement level starts at 0 and cell widths are defined per refinement level, not per block.

The `method` parameter determines the interpolation method used when sampling the volume. The `current`
method is expected to find the finest refinement level at that cell and interpolate through that "current" 
level. The `finest` method is expected to interpolate at the closest existing cell in the volume-wide 
finest refinement level regardless of the sample cell's level. Lastly, the `octant` method is expected to 
interpolate through all available refinement levels at that cell.

Applications which set unknown values for `method` will result in the default being used.
