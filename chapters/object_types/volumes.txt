[[object_types_volume]]
=== Volume

Volumes in ANARI represent volumetric objects (complementing <<Surface,
surfaces>>), encapsulating spatial data as well as appearance information. To
create a new volume object of given subtype `subtype` use

[source,cpp]
....
ANARIVolume anariNewVolume(ANARIDevice, const char *subtype);
....

[[object_types_volume_transfer_function1d]]
==== TransferFunction1D

Feature: `KHR_VOLUME_TRANSFER_FUNCTION1D`

The 1D transfer function volume is created by passing the subtype string
`transferFunction1D` to `anariNewVolume`. It supports the folowing parameter:

.Parameters understood by the tf1d volume.

| field            |`SPATIAL_FIELD`       |         | <<object_types_spatial_field, Spatial field>> used for the field values of the volume

| color            |`ARRAY1D` of <<Color>>|         | array to map sampled and clamped field values to color
| opacity          |`ARRAY1D` of `FLOAT32`|         | array to map sampled and clamped field values to opacity
| densityScale     |`FLOAT32`             |       1 | makes volumes uniformly thinner or thicker

|===================================================================================================

The `color` and the `opacity` array map values sampled in `field`
(clamped to `valueRange`) into output colors and opacities used for
volume rendering, respectively.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The `color` and `opacity` arrays together represent a transfer function,
which is used to visually emphasize the structure or certain features in
the `field` data. Both arrays can be of different size.
====

The values in the `color` and `opacity` arrays are assumed to be uniformly
distributed within `valueRange`, with the first element representing the lowest
value in `valueRange` and the last element representing the the last element in
`valueRange`.
