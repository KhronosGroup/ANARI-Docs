[[api_concepts]]
== Common API Concepts

This section describes concepts common to all object types for creation,
parameterization, and property queries.

[[api_concepts_scene_hierarchy]]
=== Scene Hierarchy (Informative)

ANARI scenes are represented as hierarchies of objects. This section
describes their relationship to each other.

The <<frame>> is the root object of the scene. It holds the framebuffer
configuration and the <<world>>, <<camera>>, and <<renderer>> objects.  The
<<camera>> configures the projection of the rendering used to view the
<<world>>.  The <<renderer>> holds parameters relating to the rendering
algorithm.  The <<world>> holds arrays of the drawable objects of the scene such
as <<surface>>, <<volume>>, and <<light>> either directly or via an array of
<<instance,Instances>> containing <<group>>. A <<group>> holds arrays of
<<surface>>, <<volume>>, and <<light>> to be instanced together. An <<instance>>
combines a <<group>> with a transform for placement of the same collection of
objects at multiple locations within the same <<world>>. A <<surface>>
represents drawable surfaces containing a <<geometry>> and a <<material>>. A
<<geometry>> specifies drawable primitives and data associated with them. A
<<material>> specifies the surface's appearance related to the data from the
<<geometry>>. A <<volume>> represents volumetric drawable objects and may
contain <<spatial_field>> objects. A <<spatial_field>> represents a field
of values in 3D space. A <<light>> represents sources of illumination.

The following diagram illustrates the relationships described above:

image::images/anari_hierarchy.png[]

[[api_concepts_object_definition]]
=== Object Definition

All objects are characterized by the following items

- Objects are represented as an <<api_concepts_handles,opaque handle>>
- Objects must be able to accept <<api_concepts_parameters,parameters>>
- Objects must be able to post <<api_concepts_object_properties,properties>>
- An object application reference count must only be modifiable by
`anariRelease` and `anariRetain`


[[api_concepts_handles]]
=== Object Handle Representation

Objects and devices in ANARI are represented by opaque 64-bit handles. The
`NULL` handle never represents a valid object. Handles are only valid for the
device from which they were created, and using handles with other devices leads
to undefined behavior.

[[api_concepts_lifetimes]]
=== Object Creation and Lifetime

Objects are created by calling an `anariNew` factory function (for example
`anariNewGeometry`). Each object type has its own corresponding factory
function. All objects, including devices, are only valid in the process in which
they are created.

Object lifetime is managed by opaque reference counting. Objects have a
public and internal reference count. Objects are created with a public
reference count of 1, which can be increased with `anariRetain` and
decreased with `anariRelease`. Once the public reference count has been
decreased to 0, the object becomes inaccessible to host code, where using its
handle in subsequent API calls is invalid and results in undefined behavior.

The signatures to `anariRelease` and `anariRetain` are as follows

[source,cpp]
----
void anariRelease(ANARIDevice, ANARIObject);

void anariRetain(ANARIDevice, ANARIObject);
----

Calling `anariRelease` with a `NULL` object-handle for the second
argument is not an error.
The internal reference count is managed by the API and will keep objects
alive for as long as the implementation needs them. Therefore, user code may
release objects as soon as it no longer requires access to them.


[[api_concepts_parameters]]
=== Parameters, Types, and Commits

Objects are configured by parameters, which are identified by a string name and
are set using `anariSetParameter`. Multiple types can be valid for a parameter,
but only one type can be set for a particular parameter name at any given time.
Setting a parameter with a different type overwrites its previous value and
type.  Attempting to set a parameter that is unknown to the implementation
has no effect on object state, but may cause an ANARI device implementation
to emit warnings. The same applies if an unsupported type for a parameter is used.

The signatures to `anariSetParameter` is as follows

[source,cpp]
----
void anariSetParameter(
  ANARIDevice,
  ANARIObject,
  const char *parameter,
  ANARIDataType,
  const void *value
);
----

The `ANARI_STRING` valued parameter named `name` on all object types is reserved
across all implementations and can optionally be used by applications to inject
human readable identifiers into the command stream. This can be useful for
debugging purposes, for example. Implementations are allowed to ignore this
parameter and must not emit warnings when it is present.

Changes to parameter values must only take effect once `anariCommitParameters`
has been called on the object:

[source,cpp]
----
void anariCommitParameters(ANARIDevice, ANARIObject);
----

Uncommitted parameters must have no effect on the behavior of the object
during rendering operations. Calling `anariCommitParameters` while an object is
participating in a <<rendering_frames, rendering operation>> is
undefined behavior.

Data types passed to and returned from ANARI are specified using the
`ANARIDataType` enum. The enum values identify ANARI object data types
and C data types. Types starting with `ANARI` are provided by the
ANARI headers. All other types refer to C99 types.
See Table 1 below for a complete list.

Values set on objects are passed as a `void *` in `anariSetParameter`, which
points to the value to be read.  The type is encoded by the passed in
`ANARIDataType` enum. For example, this means that, given `ANARI_INT`, the
implementation casts the input `void * value` to `int *` and dereferences it
accordingly. There are, however, two exceptions: `ANARI_STRING` and
`ANARI_VOID_POINTER` (`const char *` and `void *` respectively) are object
pointer based types, so they are instead passed by value.

Object parameters can be unset using `anariUnsetParameter`, which returns the
named parameter back to a state as if it had not been set. Just like with
setting parameters, changes made by `anariUnsetParameter` must only be
applied when the object is committed.

The signature to `anariUnsetParameter` is as follows

[source,cpp]
----
void anariUnsetParameter(
  ANARIDevice,
  ANARIObject,
  const char *parameter
);
----

.Data types.
[cols="<,<,<2",options="header,unbreakable"]
|===================================================================================================
include::type_table.txt[]
|===================================================================================================

Floating point number (data types with `FLOAT`) layout and behaviour are as specified in <<ieee-754>>.

[[color]]
==== Color

The following data types must be accepted by geometry's `color` attribute
parameter and by <<standard_subtypes_samplers>> and are grouped here to allow
for brevity:

* `UFIXED8`
* `UFIXED8_VEC2`
* `UFIXED8_VEC3`
* `UFIXED8_VEC4`
* `UFIXED16`
* `UFIXED16_VEC2`
* `UFIXED16_VEC3`
* `UFIXED16_VEC4`
* `UFIXED32`
* `UFIXED32_VEC2`
* `UFIXED32_VEC3`
* `UFIXED32_VEC4`
* `FLOAT32`
* `FLOAT32_VEC2`
* `FLOAT32_VEC3`
* `FLOAT32_VEC4`
* `UFIXED8_RGBA_SRGB`
* `UFIXED8_RGB_SRGB`
* `UFIXED8_RA_SRGB`
* `UFIXED8_R_SRGB`


[[api_concepts_introspection]]
=== Object Introspection

ANARI supports introspection of objects, i.e., querying supported object
subtypes and information about their parameters, which is particularly useful
to enumerate and inspect implementation-specific object extensions. The intended
use is to allow for building a graphical user interface for, e.g., specific
renderers or materials, and to provide hints for the debug layer to aid in
validating extensions.  Because the meta-information of objects and parameters
supported by devices is static, it can be queried without creating a device
first by passing the device name.

[source,cpp]
----
const char **anariGetDeviceSubtypes(ANARILibrary);
----

To get a list of device subtypes implemented in a library, call function
`anariGetDeviceSubtypes`. It returns `NULL` if there are no devices, or a
`NULL`-terminated list of `0`-terminated C-strings with the names of the
devices. The first (if any) device is the default device.

[source,cpp]
----
const char **anariGetObjectSubtypes(
    ANARILibrary, const char *deviceSubtype, ANARIDataType objectType);
----

To enumerate the subtypes of type `objectType` supported by device
`deviceSubtype` call function `anariGetObjectSubtypes`. It returns `NULL` if
there are no subtypes, or a `NULL`-terminated list of `0`-terminated C-strings
with the names of the subtypes. The following object types are expected to have
subtypes:

* `GEOMETRY`
* `SAMPLER`
* `MATERIAL`
* `SPATIAL_FIELD`
* `VOLUME`
* `LIGHT`
* `CAMERA`
* `RENDERER`

[source,cpp]
----
typedef struct
{
  const char *name;
  ANARIDataType type;
} ANARIParameter;

const void *anariGetObjectInfo(ANARILibrary,
    const char *deviceSubtype,
    ANARIDataType objectType,
    const char *objectSubtype
    const char *infoName,
    ANARIDataType infoType);
----

An object (sub)type `objectType`/`objectSubtype` can be queried for information
with `anariGetObjectInfo` (passing `NULL` or an empty string
for `objectSubtype` to query an object type directly that does not have
subtypes). The function returns the result for `infoName` of type `infoType`, or
`NULL` if the info cannot be retrieved.
The following infos of objects can be queried:

.Info of objects for introspection.
[cols="<,<,^,<4",options="header,unbreakable"]
|===================================================================================================
| Name          | Type             | Required | Description
| description   | `STRING`         |    No    | explanation of the object, e.g., for a tooltip
| parameter     | `PARAMETER_LIST` |    Yes   | list of supported parameters (array of `ANARIParameter`)
| channel       | `STRING_LIST`    | for ``FRAME`` | list of supported channels
|===================================================================================================

Parameters that can be of multiple types are reported multiple times (once for
each supported variant: with the same `name`, but different `type`).

[source,cpp]
----
const void *anariGetParameterInfo(ANARILibrary,
    const char *deviceSubtype,
    ANARIDataType objectType,
    const char *objectSubtype,
    const char *parameterName,
    ANARIDataType parameterType,
    const char *infoName,
    ANARIDataType infoType);
----

Finally, a parameter can be inspected with `anariGetParameterInfo`,
returning the result for `infoName` of type `infoType`, or `NULL` if the
info cannot be retrieved.
The following infos of parameters can be queried:

.Info of parameters for introspection.
[cols="<,<,^,<4",options="header,unbreakable"]
|===================================================================================================
| Name          | Type        | Required | Description
| description   | `STRING`    |    No    | explanation of the parameter, e.g., for a tooltip
| minimum       | type        |    No    | set values will be clamped to this minimum
| maximum       | type        |    No    | set values will be clamped to this maximum
| default       | type        |    No    | default value, must be in `minimum`..`maximum` if present
| elementType   |`DATA_TYPE_LIST`| for ``ARRAY``s | array of supported element types of the `ANARIArray` parameter, with last element `UNKNOWN`
| required      | `BOOL`      |    Yes   | whether the parameter must be set for an object to be valid,
                                        must be `FALSE` if a `default` is present
| value         |`STRING_LIST` or `DATA_TYPE_LIST` |    No    | list of accepted strings or data types for parameters that only recognize specific values
|===================================================================================================


[[api_concepts_object_properties]]
=== Object Properties

Implementations may expose object properties through the object query
interface.

[source,cpp]
----
int anariGetProperty(ANARIDevice,
    ANARIObject,
    const char *propertyName,
    ANARIDataType propertyType,
    void *memory,
    uint64_t size,
    uint32_t waitMask);
----

Properties are identified by a string name and type. The `waitMask` indicates
whether the property query will wait for the value to become available or should
return instantly.

If the property is available, the value will be written to `memory`, and the function
returns `1`. Otherwise, the value is not written to `memory`, and the return value is `0`.

The length of a string property can be queried as an `ANARI_ULONG` by appending
`.size` to the property name.

At most `size` bytes will be written to `memory`.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Return value does not replace error handling via the callbacks.
A property may be unavailable for various reasons including not being supported
by the device, the value not being computed yet, or any other device-specific
reason. Errors related to property queries are still returned via the error
callback.
====

[[api_concepts_features]]
=== Feature Queries
Core features and extension features are identified by string names. Supported
features may be queried from device and renderer objects using
`anariGetObjectInfo` and `anariGetProperty` by querying for a `STRING_LIST`
named `"feature"`.

Queries using `anariGetObjectInfo` return a static list of features the object
type is capable of supporting. Queries using `anariGetProperty` return the
dynamic list of features supported by a specific object instance. The dynamic
list returned for an object instance is a subset of of the static list returned
for the object type. Some features may be missing from the instance because they
depend on factors (hardware, drivers etc.) that are only known once an instance
has been created and configured.

.List of core features
[cols="<,<2",options="header,unbreakable"]
|===================================================================================================
| Name                           | Description
| `KHR_GEOMETRY_TRIANGLE`        | Adds the `"triangle"` geometry subtype and its parameters
| `KHR_GEOMETRY_CONES`           | Adds the `"cone"` geometry subtype and its parameters
| `KHR_DEVICE_SYNCHRONIZATION`   | Relaxes synchronization requirements for device objects
| `KHR_WORLD_BOUNDS_QUERY`       | Bounds can be queried from world objects
| `KHR_RENDERER_SHADOWS`         | Renderer renders shadows
| ... | ...
|===================================================================================================

[[api_concepts_memory]]
=== Arrays and Memory Ownership
:array: <<api_concepts_memory, array>>

`ANARIArray` handles represent data arrays in memory, which are shared with
device implementations. The memory shared with ANARI can be either owned
by the application, have ownership transferred to the device via a deleter
callback, or be managed by the device. Input data has dimensions encoded
in its handle type, where each dimension can have a sparse stride.

The signature of the deleter is provided in `anari.h` as

[source,cpp]
....
typedef void (*ANARIMemoryDeleter)(const void *userPtr, const void *appMemory);
....

To create a data array, use any of the following API calls based on the
desired dimension:

[source,cpp]
....
ANARIArray1D anariNewArray1D(ANARIDevice,
   const void *appMemory,
   ANARIMemoryDeleter,
   const void *userPtr,
   ANARIDataType elementType,
   uint64_t numItems,
   uint64_t byteStride);

ANARIArray2D anariNewArray2D(ANARIDevice,
   const void *appMemory,
   ANARIMemoryDeleter,
   const void *userPtr,
   ANARIDataType elementType,
   uint64_t numItems1,
   uint64_t numItems2,
   uint64_t byteStride1,
   uint64_t byteStride2);

ANARIArray3D anariNewArray3D(ANARIDevice,
   const void *appMemory,
   ANARIMemoryDeleter,
   const void *userPtr,
   ANARIDataType elementType,
   uint64_t numItems1,
   uint64_t numItems2,
   uint64_t numItems3,
   uint64_t byteStride1,
   uint64_t byteStride2,
   uint64_t byteStride3);
....

The number of elements `numItemsN` must be positive (there cannot be an
empty array object). The distance between consecutive elements (per
dimension) is given in bytes with `byteStrideN`. If a `byteStrideN` is
zero, it will be determined automatically (e.g., as `sizeof(type)`).
Strides do not need to be ordered. For example, `byteStride2` can be smaller
than `byteStride1`, which is equivalent to a transpose. However, if the
stride should be calculated, then an ordering in dimensions is assumed
to disambiguate, i.e., `byteStride1 < byteStride2 < byteStride3`.

In each creation function a deleter can be passed in (with an
associated pointer to any needed application data or state), which ANARI will
use to free the original pointer passed during construction. If the application
passes `NULL`, ANARI will fully rely on the application to free the memory.

When `appMemory` is not `NULL`, then the array is considered to be a _shared_
array, where both the application and device observe the same memory.  Passing
`NULL` in `appMemory` creates a _managed_ array. The backing memory of the array
is managed by the device and is only writable via mapping.  Device managed
arrays can only have dense layouts (`byteStrideN = 0`).

Applications are permitted to release `ANARIArray` objects even if the
device still contains internal references to it. When releasing a
shared array object ANARI relinquishes shared ownership of the memory,
which may result in the creation of internal copies. When a shared array is
created with a deleter callback, it is implementation defined when an
implementation frees host memory after the array object has been released.
Deleter callbacks are never called for managed arrays.

Applications are only permitted to write to the memory visible to
`ANARIArray` objects if all array objects involved are mapped. Mapping
an array object indicates that the device should not execute any
rendering operations (or internal state updates, such as building
acceleration structures) of any parent objects to the mapped array object.

Array objects are mapped using

[source,cpp]
....
void* anariMapArray(ANARIDevice, ANARIArray);
....

Mapped array objects are unmapped using

[source,cpp]
....
void anariUnmapArray(ANARIDevice, ANARIArray);
....

Mapping a shared array will always result in the same address originally used
when constructing the array object.  Mapping a managed array may return a
different pointer each time it is mapped. The contents of memory mapped from
managed arrays is undefined until written to and the entire mapped range must be
specified before unmapping to avoid populating the array with undefined values.

`ANARIArray` objects containing object handles increase the ref count
of all objects in the array. Reference counts are updated on creation
of the array object and when unmapping the array.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Array parameters of objects that are accessed by the same index (because
they represent an "array of structures") have per naming convention a
common prefix followed by a period. The byte strides of arrays allow
such "transformation" without changing the actual memory layout. An
example are the vertex attributes of the
<<standard_subtypes_geometry_triangle, triangle geometry>>, which all
start with `vertex.` followed by the attribute name.
====

Arrays define a valid region of elements, which by default is always the full
capacity of the array. Implementations can allow applications to keep a singular
allocation of data, but use a parameter to tell the implementation only to use a
subset of elements. This gives applications the ability to more efficiently
change the number of elements used by parent objects at the cost of memory size
efficiency.

Implementations provide this functionality by implementing
<<core_extensions_array1d_region, extension `KHR_ARRAY1D_REGION`>>, which adds
the following parameter to `ANARIArray1D`:

.Additional parameters accepted by `ANARIArray1D` with <<core_extensions_array1d_region, extension `KHR_ARRAY1D_REGION`>>.
[cols="<,<,<4",options="header,unbreakable"]
|==================================================================
| Name     | Type            | Description
| region   |`UINT64_REGION1` | region of elements currently in use
|==================================================================

If `region` is not set, all elements are used as specified when the array was
constructed. When `region` is set, it is clamped to the range of the array's
constructed size respectively and warnings should be emitted by the debug layer
if `region.upper` is larger than capacity.

The values specified by `region` are clamped such that the array will always
be a valid range containing at least one element. Thus `region` is clamped
according to the following:

- `region.upper` is clamped from below by `region.lower + 1`
- `region.upper` is clamped from above by the array's capacity
- `region.lower` is clamped from above by `region.upper` - 1`

Mapping an array always returns the full capacity, regardless of the elements
specified by `region`. Object handles within `region` must always be valid.
Object arrays can be constructed with invalid handles, as long as the array
`region` contains only valid handles by the time the array is used in a render
operation.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
As with all `REGION` types, the element from `region.lower` is _inclusive_,
while `region.upper` is _exclusive_. This is intended to mimic C++ begin/end
iterators on containers.
====

[[api_concepts_libraries]]
=== Libraries

ANARI libraries are the mechanism that applications use to manage API device
implementations. Libraries are solely responsible for creating instances of
<<api_concepts_devices, devices>>. Implementors may use a library to cache
data or objects which are truly global to their device implementations, such
as contexts from underlying APIs. Libraries are generally the first thing
loaded by an application and the last thing cleaned up. While libraries are
represented by an opaque handle, they are not considered an object per the
given <<api_concepts_object_definition,definition>> of an object and are thus
only usable in API calls which explicitly take `ANARILibrary` handles.

To load a library, use

[source,cpp]
....
ANARILibrary anariLoadLibrary(const char *name,
  ANARIStatusCallback defaultStatusCallback,
  const void *defaultStatusCallbackUserData);
....

This will look for a shared library named `anari_library_[name]`, open it,
and look for entry points for (implementation defined) initialization. The
status callback passed is used as the default value for the `statusCallback`
parameter on devices created from the returned library object. Similarly, the
user pointer passed is used as the default value for the
`statusCallbackUserData` device parameter.

To unload a library (where library resource cleanup occurs), use

[source,cpp]
....
void anariUnloadLibrary(ANARILibrary);
....

It is undefined behavior to unload a library while instances of devices from
that library have not been released.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Vendors are also permitted to implement direct device creation
functions to allow an application to directly link their ANARI library at
compile time. Please reference your vendor's documentation for whether direct
linking is supported by their ANARI library.
====

[[api_concepts_devices]]
=== Devices

ANARI coordinates the use of one or more _devices_. A device is an object
which provides the implementation of all ANARI API calls outside of libraries.
Devices represent the global state which an implementor may reuse between
different objects to render images. It is common for applications to only use
one device at a time, but the API permits concurrent use of multiple devices
to independently render from each other.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
ANARI devices are a _software_ construct. Because ANARI abstracts away the
details of an entire rendering system, the underlying hardware which a device
may use is entirely up to the implemetation. Please read your vendor's device
documentation to see what parameters are available to configure and what
underlying hardware is both available and used to render frames.
====

The ANARI device is responsible for coordinating the sharing of execution
resources with the calling application, such as a CPU thread pool or GPU
kernel queues.

ANARI devices are represented by an `ANARIDevice` handle and created using

[source,cpp]
....
ANARIDevice anariNewDevice(ANARILibrary, const char *subtype);
....


Version information can be queried as properties on the `ANARIDevice`
<<api_concepts_object_properties, using `anariGetProperty`>>.

.Properties queryable on devices.

| geometryMaxIndex|`UINT64`|  Yes    | largest supported index into vertex arrays in <<standard_subtypes_geometries, geometries>>
|===================================================================================================

[[api_concepts_error_handling]]
=== Error Handling

Errors and other messages (warnings, validation messages, debug
information etc.) from the device are reported via a status callback.
The status callback function can be set using

[source,cpp]
....
typedef void (*ANARIStatusCallback)(const void *userPtr,
    ANARIDevice,
    ANARIObject source,
    ANARIDataType sourceType,
    ANARIStatusSeverity,
    ANARIStatusCode,
    const char *message);
....

The following values for `ANARIStatusCode` are defined:

* `STATUS_NO_ERROR`
* `STATUS_UNKNOWN_ERROR`
* `STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`
* `STATUS_INVALID_OPERATION`
* `STATUS_OUT_OF_MEMORY`
* `STATUS_UNSUPPORTED_DEVICE`
* `STATUS_VERSION_MISMATCH`

The following values for `ANARIStatusSeverity` are defined:

* `SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR`
* `SEVERITY_ERROR`
* `SEVERITY_WARNING`
* `SEVERITY_PERFORMANCE_WARNING`
* `SEVERITY_INFO`
* `SEVERITY_DEBUG`

.Parameters accepted by all devices.

|===================================================================================================
| Name                   | Type            | Description

//|logOutput|`STRING` |convenience for setting where status messages go, possible values: `stderr`, `stdout`
//|errorOutput |`STRING`|convenience for setting where error messages go, possible values: `stderr`, `stdout`


Statuses may be reported at an undefined time after the API call
causing them is made. Furthermore, these callbacks must
themselves be thread safe as they can be called on any thread.

[[api_concepts_attributes]]
=== Attributes

Attributes are quantities that are passed between objects during
rendering. Attributes are identified by strings.

Surface attributes are passed from <<Geometry, geometries>> to
<<Material, materials>> and <<Sampler, samplers>>. Attributes are either
set explicitly by user-provided data as array parameters (and may be
interpolated in a geometry-specific way) or implicitly by the surface.
Unspecified (components of) attributes default to zero for the first
three components and to one for the fourth component.
