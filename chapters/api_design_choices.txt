[[api_choices]]
== API Design Choices

Here we outline several fundamental ANARI API design choices that address key
goals of broad application and programming language support, and ease of
application development, integration, testing, and distribution.

[[api_choices_c99]]
=== C99

The ANARI API is specified as a C99 API in order to provide
compiler-independent linkage, thereby supporting easy integration into a
broad range of applications based on a variety of compiled languages,
including C, pass:[C++], Fortran, and dynamic languages such as Python and
Julia, among others. C99 provides improved IEEE-754 floating point rounding
behavior, integer types in common with pass:[C++], and other refinements
relative to ANSI C.

[[api_choices_library]]
=== Common Front-end Library

ANARI is specified as a common API header and front-end library (using either
static or dynamic linkage) capable of loading available ANARI back-end device
implementations at runtime, known as <<api_concepts_devices, _devices_>>.
ANARI back-end devices are created by standard implementors and are expected
to be distributed, installed, or upgraded independently of the standard API
header and front-end library.


[[api_choices_objects]]
=== Opaque Objects, Parameterization, and Properties

The ANARI API is designed to encapsulate scene data and rendering operations
as opaque object handles using string-value pairs to parameterize them. This
facilitates a dominantly unidirectional flow of scene information from the
application to the instantiated ANARI device. As a result, the vast majority of
ANARI API calls have a write-only behavior pattern to minimize imposed
implementation requirements.

An application can create ANARI objects and set named inputs on them called
_parameters_. However, no mechanism is provided to subsequently query
parameter data, since even the existence of a query mechanism
would impose additional performance and storage restrictions for back-end
renderer implementations (e.g. distributed rendering contexts).
<<api_concepts_introspection, Object introspection>> can be used to query object
subtypes and information about their parameters.

Additionally, ANARI objects can publish named outputs called _properties_. Such
output is specific to the type and semantics of the object, but has a generic
interface function for access.



[[api_choices_thread_safety]]
=== Thread Safety, Asynchronous Operations

The ANARI API may be called from any thread but calls that share objects
must be synchronized and may not overlap. By default, this includes the device.
Therefore, calls to the same device must be externally synchronized.

Devices may relax this restriction via a
<<core_extensions_relaxed_device_synchronization,core extension>>.


Expensive operations can be implemented asynchronously, which avoids blocking
the calling application. Each asynchronous operation is specified as to what
API calls are legal to make while the operation has not yet completed.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Making some operations asynchronous complements the thread safety of ANARI, and
typically is used for a different purpose. Where a multithreaded application
may be trying to work on constructing a scene (which could be many smaller
ANARI API calls) while another scene is being rendered in parallel,
asynchronous rendering focuses on removing the need for long running
operations to cause an application to use multithreading just to avoid
blocking on ANARI.

[[api_choices_features]]
=== Features and Extensions

The capabilities of devices and renderers are expressed through features.
Core features are defined by the ANARI specification while extension
features are defined by third parties such as vendors.

The ANARI specification defines a set of fundamental API functions, data types,
enums, object types and parameters that provide the base functionality of creating
objects and expressing a scene hiearchy.

On top of this base functionality core features provide common rendering
functionality through objects and parameters
that specify concrete types of geometries, volumes, cameras, materials etc.. Core
features may also extend the API with types, functions and parameters beyond
the fundamentals whose implementability or meaningfulness is not universal but
sufficiently common to support cross vendor standardization.

Extension features allow vendors to use the same mechanism as core features to
add further functionality that is specific to their platform or use case.

Features provide a well-defined software mechanism
for applications and ANARI devices to negotiate the availability of
standardized and vendor provided capabilities which ANARI implementations
may choose to support. By categorizing ANARI functionality
among multiple core features, implementors are free to choose to support
features that are well matched to their core rendering algorithms, their
target hardware, and their renderer design trade-offs, without taking on
implementation of features that would otherwise be prohibitively complex,
costly to performance, or impractical to incorporate for other reasons.

[[api_choices_distributed_rendering]]
=== Support for Distributed Applications (Informative)

ANARI is designed to be compatible with applications which are distributed
across multiple processes which may reside on multiple machines. ANARI
implementors provide distributed rendering capabilities using existing API
semantics relevant to running in distributed environments, such as multiple
processes invoking API calls in lock-step.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Interoperability with underlying
networking APIs, such as MPI, are expected to be documented by the vendor.
