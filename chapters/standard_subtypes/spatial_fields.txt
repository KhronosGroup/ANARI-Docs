=== Spatial Fields

This section outlines spatial field subtypes which are supplied by complete
ANARI device implementations.

==== Structured Regular

Structured regular spatial fields are created by passing the subtype string
`structuredRegular` to <<spatial_field, `anariNewSpatialField`>>. The parameters
understood by structured regular spatial fields are summarized in the table below.

.Configuration parameters for structured regular spatial fields.

|===================================================================================================
| Name    | Type           |    Default | Description
| data    |`ARRAY3D` of `UINT8` / `INT16` / `UINT16` / `FLOAT32` / `FLOAT64` | | the actual field
                                          values for the 3D grid, i.e., the scalars are
                                          vertex-centered; the size and value type of the spatial field
                                          is inferred from `data`
| origin  |`FLOAT32_VEC3`  |  (0, 0, 0) | origin of the grid in object-space
| spacing |`FLOAT32_VEC3`  |  (1, 1, 1) | size of the grid cells in object-space
| filter  |`STRING`        |    `linear`| filter used for reconstructing the field,
                                          possible values: `nearest`, `linear`
|===================================================================================================

The spatial field grid can be moved with `origin` and scaled with `spacing`, in
local object coordinates. The spatial field data is interpreted to be
vertex-centered, which means at least two data values need to be
specified in each dimension to avoid a degenerated spatial field. Its local
bounds are [`origin`, `origin` + (`data`.size - 1) {times} `spacing`].

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Structured regular fields only need to store the values of the samples, because
their addresses in memory can be easily computed from a 3D position. A
common type of structured spatial fields are regular grids.
